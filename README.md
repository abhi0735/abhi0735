# Hi there, I'm Abhishek Sharma 👋

- 👀 I’m interested in **Data Engineering** and **Azure Cloud** – I specialize in building robust data pipelines, managing large-scale data processing systems, and enabling data-driven decision-making. I work with various tools and technologies to ensure efficient and scalable data architectures, particularly in cloud environments like Azure. My expertise includes data warehousing, ETL processes, and real-time data streaming.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Databricks**, **Apache Spark**, and **Azure Tools**. These are essential in modern big data workflows, and I'm focused on leveraging them for distributed data processing and cloud-based analytics. Databricks, in particular, is helping me enhance my skills in unified analytics, while Spark allows me to work efficiently with large datasets in real-time. I'm also gaining hands-on experience with Azure cloud services to build scalable and secure data solutions.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **data engineering projects** that involve creating data pipelines, real-time analytics, machine learning model deployment, and cloud data architectures. I am also interested in collaborating on open-source projects related to data processing, optimization, and automation.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via my **GitHub** or connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhi0735)**.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and finding ways to optimize data workflows, but I also love gaming and learning about the latest in tech and AI.
